# String-Substitution-Problem

I encountered a problem on an assessment I did for an internship at Cisco which I frustratingly could not solve in the 50 minutes available for the question. After trying several ideas, I ended up with this rather computationally expensive solution. Although the number of combinations could end up extensive and it could be sped up, this was the fastest way I could accomplish the goal since I have classes!

## To clarify the problem, here is a sample input:
- INPUT: '(ab(c){2}d){2}(ab){2}'
- OUTPUT: 'abccdabccdabab'
